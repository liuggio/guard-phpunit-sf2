Guard::PHPUnit-sf2 [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/liuggio/guard-phpunit-sf2.png)](http://travis-ci.org/liuggio/guard-phpunit-sf2) [![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/liuggio/guard-phpunit-sf2.png?branch=master)](https://gemnasium.com/liuggio/guard-phpunit-sf2.png)
==============

Guard-phpunit-sf2 is just a fork of Guard-phpunit

The main goal is run guard-phpunit with Symfony2, the hope is to merge it with the original repo.

**Q:** This is Horrible why not PR the original fork?

**A:** This is a concept, I'll be very happy if you do it for me now, and there's also a issue https://github.com/Maher4Ever/guard-phpunit/issues/8]

   there are some logic difference that could be solved via options, I'd like to have enough time to do it.



If you want to see the differences between **guard-phpunit** and **guard-phpunit-sf2** here [Differences](https://github.com/liuggio/guard-phpunit-sf2/compare/master)


Guard::PHPUnit-sf2
==============


Guard-phpunit-sf2 allows you to automatically run [PHPUnit][6] tests when sources
are modified. It helps with integrating test-driven development (TDD) into
your development process: Just launch guard-phpunit before you start working
and it will notify you about the status of your tests!

*Note*: Although guard-phpunit-sf2 should work with any [PHP][7] version [PHPUnit][6] supports,
it has only been tested on [PHP][7] 5.3.8 and 5.4.4.

Install/Compile
-------

Please be sure to have [PHP][7], [PHPUnit][6] and [Ruby][1] installed on your machine before
you proceed with the installation.

guard-phpunit-sf2 has not been pushed on RubyGems. If you want to try it, clone the repository, build the gem and install it.

	git clone git://github.com/liuggio/guard-phpunit-sf2.git
	cd guard-phpunit-sf2
	gem build guard-phpunit-sf2.gemspec
	sudo gem instal guard-phpunit-sf2-0.1.4.gem

Usage
-----

Please read the [Guard usage documentation][3].

if you are lazy is easy:

1. create the Guardfile as the example below then and put it in the root of your symfony2 project

2. then run `guard`

3. modify your files with your editor


Guardfile
---------

Guard-phpunit-sf2 can be used with any kind of [PHP][7] projects that uses PHPUnit as
its testing framwork. Please read the [Guard documentation][3] for more information
about the Guardfile DSL.

By default, guard-phpunit-sf2 will use the current working directory (pwd) to
search for tests and run them on start (if you enabled the `:all_on_start` option).

### Example PHP project

The [PHPUnit documentaion][4] uses the [Object Freezer][5] library as an example on how
to organize tests. This project uses the `Tests` directory for its tests.

An example of the Guardfile for the same project would look
something like:

```ruby

guard 'phpunit', :cli => '--colors -c app/' do
     # Watch tests files
     watch(%r{^src\/.+Test\.php$})

     # Watch src file and run its test,
     # Test string: src/Tvision/Bundle/CartBundle/Repository/CartRepository.php
     watch(%r{^src\/(.+)\/(.+)Bundle\/(.+)\.php$}) { |m| "src/#{m[1]}/#{m[2]}Bundle/Tests/#{m[3]}Test.php" } # Watch all files in your bundles and run the respective tests on change
end

```

Options
-------

The following options can be passed to Guard::PHPUnit:

```ruby
:all_on_start => false        # Run all tests on startup.
                              # default: true

:all_after_pass => false      # Run all tests after changed tests pass. This ensures
                              # that the process of making changed tests pass didn't
                              # break something else.
                              # default: true

:keep_failed => false         # Remember failed tests and keep running them with
                              # each change until they pass.
                              # default: true

:tests_path => 'tests'        # Relative path to the tests directory. This path
                              # is used when running all the tests.
                              # default: the current working directory (pwd)

:cli => '--colors -c app/'    # The options passed to the phpunit command
                              # when running the tests.
                              # default: nil

:enable_progress_formatter => false # disable progress formatter
                              # default true

```
